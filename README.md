# Distributed-and-parallel-algorithms-for-quantile-regression

Our goal is to develop a software platform for big data and quantile regression analysis as an R
package or Python library. 

The current algorthim, written in C++ and R, performs it's function but we aim
to develop the functionality to allow for, one, larger datasets, and, two, a
more powerful system (be it a cluster or distributed computing setup).
