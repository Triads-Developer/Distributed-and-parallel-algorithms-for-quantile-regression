# QPADMslack
R package for nonconvex penalized quantile regression in distributed big data based on ADMM.

It can be used to reproduce the simulation studies in the following paper:

**Ye Fan, Nan Lin and Xianjun Yin**. *Penalized Quantile Regression for Distributed Big Data Using the Slack Variable Representation.*

Two main functions are included: **QPADMslack( )** and **paraQPADMslack( )**, designed for the distributed and the non-distributed computation, repectively.
